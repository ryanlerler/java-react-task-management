# Welcome to the Full-Stack Developer Coding Challenge!

Thank you for participating in the Full-Stack Developer Coding Challenge! This repository contains a sample application that you'll be working with to demonstrate your full-stack development skills.

If you have not used Java Spring Boot or React JS before, don't worry! This coding challenge provides you with existing working code that you can refer to while completing the tasks. Take some time to review the codebase and architecture, and use it as a guide to understand how the application is structured. This will help you showcase your understanding of full-stack concepts and your ability to learn and implement new features. Good luck!

## Project Overview

The application consists of the following components:
- Backend: Java Spring Boot application (Dockerized)
- Frontend: React Native application with Storybook components
- Basic UI and APIs are already implemented

Your task is to make specific modifications to showcase your understanding of various full-stack concepts and your ability to learn and implement new features.

## Getting Started (via Gitpod)

To get started with Gitpod, follow these steps:

0. If you are not already in a Gitpod, append "https://gitpod.io/#" before the url
1. Wait for a few minutes, and you will see the following windows opening automatically: 
   - Port 8080: Swagger UI for Backend APIs
   - Port 3000: Frontend React JS Application
   - Port 6006: Frontend Storybook for React Components

> [!Note]  
> If you don't see the windows opening automatically, please ensure that you have allowed pop-ups in your browser. If the windows still don't open, you can manually open them by clicking on the globe icons in the "Ports" tab on the bottom panel.

2. Take some time to review the existing codebase and architecture.
3. Complete the tasks as per the instructions provided in the `TASKS.md` file.

## Getting Started (via Local Development)

To get started with local development, follow these steps:

1. Set up your development environment by following the instructions provided in the `SETUP.md` file.
2. Take some time to review the existing codebase and architecture.
3. Complete the tasks as per the instructions provided in the `TASKS.md` file.

## Submission Process

To submit your work, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch for your changes.
2. Commit your changes with **meaningful** commit messages. We recommend using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) for your commit messages.
3. Push your branch to the repository.
4. Create a pull request with a description of the changes you've made.
5. Submit the pull request link in the application portal as a comment.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

| Criteria | Description | Weight |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Technical Proficiency | Correct implementation of required features, proper use of frameworks and tools | 30% |
| Code Quality | Readability, maintainability, error handling, use of design patterns | 25% |
| Problem-Solving Skills | Ability to debug and resolve issues, creative solutions | 15% |
| Learning Ability | Effectiveness in learning and implementing new concepts | 10% |
| Version Control | Proper use of Git, quality of pull request | 10% |
| Communication | Code comments, documentation, ability to explain decisions | 5% |
| Attention to Detail | Thoroughness in implementation, handling of edge cases | 5% |

## Time Limit

You have a maximum of 3 calendar days to complete as many tasks as possible. However, we recommend not spending more than 90 minutes on this challenge. Quality is valued over quantity, so focus on delivering well-implemented features rather than trying to complete everything if time is short.

## Questions and Support

If you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the project, please leave a comment in the application portal. We're here to help!

Good luck, and we look forward to reviewing your work!
